# working sql with keith for jegan's stock

## yo keith check it out, i think i got it

i wanted to model all my data in json  
so i started with [stock.json](https://github.com/wommy/keith-jegan-stock-sql/blob/master/stock.json)

from there i easily split it into [products](https://github.com/wommy/keith-jegan-stock-sql/blob/master/products.js) and [stock](https://github.com/wommy/keith-jegan-stock-sql/blob/master/stock.js)

then i did the [orders](https://github.com/wommy/keith-jegan-stock-sql/blob/master/orders.js)

before i finished up with some [logic](https://github.com/wommy/keith-jegan-stock-sql/blob/master/logic.js)

yeah its so pseudo code, but i think itll work pretty well  
lmk what you think
